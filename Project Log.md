### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Fixed fitToContent Function**
```typescript
const fitToContent = useCallback(() => {
  if (!placedEquipment || placedEquipment.length === 0) {
    resetCanvas()
    return
  }

  // Calculate bounding box of all equipment including clearance zones
  let minX = Infinity, maxX = -Infinity
  let minY = Infinity, maxY = -Infinity

  placedEquipment.forEach(equipment => {
    // ... bounding box calculation logic
  })

  // Calculate optimal scale and position
  const optimalScale = Math.min(scaleX, scaleY, 2) // Cap at 2x zoom
  const newX = (stageSize.width / 2) - (centerX * optimalScale)
  const newY = (stageSize.height / 2) - (centerY * optimalScale)

  // Apply to both stage and state
  if (stageRef.current) {
    stageRef.current.scale({ x: optimalScale, y: optimalScale })
    stageRef.current.position({ x: newX, y: newY })
    stageRef.current.batchDraw()
  }
  
  setCanvasState({ scale: optimalScale, x: newX, y: newY })
}, [placedEquipment, equipmentDefinitions, stageSize, resetCanvas])
```

#### **Key Problem Resolution**
- **Root Cause:** Function calculated correct values but only applied test zoom (50%) to stage
- **Solution:** Removed test implementation and ensured calculated values are applied to stage
- **Verification:** Tested with multiple equipment pieces, confirmed proper zoom/center behavior

---

### 📋 **Development Preparation**

#### **Next Major Feature: Custom Clearance Shapes**
**Complexity Assessment:** Medium-High (3-5 days estimated)
**User Request:** Polygonal clearance zones with up to 20 points, angle constraints per corner
